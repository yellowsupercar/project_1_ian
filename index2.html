      What is ping in video games?
    </h1>
    <p>
       Ping, or Packet InterNet Grope, in video games, is the time it takes from your computer / console / client to the game server network.
      When playing, you will sometimes encounter lag when someone is either downloading something in your home, or if you are very far from your router.
      People who have less ping will be ablee to play smoothly and people who have ping with 300 ms will start teleporting around because they can't catch up with the server.

      How to stop high ping
    </h1>
    <p style="background-color : cyan">
      There are many ways to stop high ping. One way is to stay near your router. My router is in my room so I don't experience lag that much when im playing video games.
      If you are still experiencing high ping, someone in your household may be downloading something. Another way to stop high ping fast is to close your applications. If you have 15 windows outside of the game then this might be the reason why.
      I will show a step by step trick on how to get rid of high ping for windows.
      <ol>
        <li style="color : Blue">
         Click the start button and go to the search bar and type cmd. If you are using windows 10, click the search bar on the bottom left and type cmd. This will bring up the command prompt.
       </li>
       <li style="color : Blue"> Next, make sure you run the app as administrator.
       Now, right where it says "C:/Users/(Your name)" Type in "ipconfig /flushdns and it will refresh your connection."
     </li>
     <p style="background-color : blue"> This works for me because when i'm playing a game, I usually type this command on command prompt.
       You can do this everytime you see your ping go up and this really helps. You can keep spamming the same command over and over again.
